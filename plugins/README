webgaim.pl:
    Perl Plugin for gaim. Not recommended.

webgaim.c:
    Plugin for GAIM prior to the Pidgin change over. This code is no longer supported, but here for people who still run the old GAIM codebase.

webpidgin.c:
    This is a port of webgaim.c to the Pidgin/LibPurple API. The author hasn't had time to continue working on this project so it has not been updated in quite a while.

webpidginz.c:
    This is a fork of webpidgin.c by shaorang.

Building (stand-alone):
    `make` or `make LDFLAGS=-lws2_32` (you may still need `internal.h` from Pidgin sources)

Building (in-tree):
    Copy sources to pidgin/plugins
    `make webpidginz.so`

Installation:
    Copy the .so to your lib/pidgin directory or to your .purple/plugins directory
    Restart pidgin, the plugin should now show up in your plugins list.
