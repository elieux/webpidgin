webgaim.pl:
    Perl Plugin for gaim. Not recommended.

webgaim.c:
    Plugin for GAIM prior to the Pidgin change over. This code is no longer supported, but here for people who still run the old GAIM codebase.

webpidgin.c:
    This is a port of webgaim.c to the Pidgin/LibPurple API. The author hasn't had time to continue working on this project so it has not been updated in quite a while.

    This is a fork of webpidgin.c by shaorang.

Linux:
    Copy the file to pidgin/plugins
    make webpidginz.so
    copy the so to your {INSTALLDIR}/lib/pidgin directory
    restart pidgin, the plugin should now show up in your plugins list.
